Loadable Mod-10 Up/Down Counter
//Description
This repository contains the Verilog code for a Loadable Mod-10 Up/Down Counter. The counter supports counting up or down from 0 to 9 (mod-10) and has a loadable feature to set a specific start value.

//Features
Loadable Value: Allows the counter to start counting from a user-defined value.
Up/Down Control: Supports counting in both upward and downward directions.
Mod-10 Operation: The counter wraps around after reaching 9 when counting up and 0 when counting down.
Reset Function: Includes a reset functionality to initialize the counter.

//Functional Overview
The design uses standard Verilog coding practices and aims for clarity and simplicity. It is useful for educational purposes and basic digital design projects.


//Prerequisites
Verilog simulation tools such as ModelSim, QuestaSim, or Synopsys VCS.
